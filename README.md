# FITTS' LAW ECOSYSTEM | V7.7
### HIGH-PERFORMANCE INTERACTION ARCHITECTURE

A research-grade analytical suite engineered for benchmarking human movement dynamics across diverse digital environments. This ecosystem provides high-fidelity simulations for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research and competitive interaction benchmarking.

---

## THE EVOLUTION GPARENA
The core of the V7 ecosystem is a synchronized, three-phase progression system designed for multi-variable movement analysis.

### PHASE 01: TRAINING 
Large, static targets established for base movement time (MT) calibration and hardware synchronization.

### PHASE 02: CALIBRATION 
Medium-scale targets with low-frequency linear drift to measure predictive tracking efficiency.

### PHASE 03: ELITE ARENA
Small, adaptive targets with high-velocity drift and performance-based scaling for stress-testing accuracy.
